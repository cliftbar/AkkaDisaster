Companion application for [FlaPyDisaster](https://github.com/cliftbar/FlaPyDisaster) to run hurricane calculations in Scala.  Uses Akka Http as a server framework, and includes the hurricane calculation JAR from [Disaster Modeling](https://github.com/cliftbar/DisasterModeling).  This replaces [FlaPyScala](https://github.com/cliftbar/FlaPyScala) as the calculation server, as the Play framework is more oriented towards driving a front end, while this app only needs api endpoints.
